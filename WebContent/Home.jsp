<p>
In today's complex world, children's futures are determined by their ability to master the basics of reading, science, math and computers.
Yet costs, class sizes and other issues often prevent children access to quality online learning that can support and reinforce these essential skills.
Our vision is to be the source for childhood learning on the internet available from anywhere.
We offer best-in-class courses in Mathematics, Science, Computer Science; and we're building a community for parents and educators to share innovations and insights in childhood education.
